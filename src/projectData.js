                are created entirely with frontend technologies Iâ€™m familiar
                with, without using any frameworks or build tools. This project
                demonstrates my ability to design and structure a complete

                displaying a grid of popular video thumbnails, titles, and view
                counts. It was built to practice and demonstrate my skills in
